                <p>My heartfelt tribute to the most incredible father in the whole world. No one can compare to my Father and that's that. <b>FACTS!üòåüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</b></p>
                <p><b>IMPACT ON ME;</b></p>
                <p>My father is a man like no other. He has loved me unconditionally and through this I've learnt how to be selfless and mindful of others.</p>
                <p>He has taught me to look out for others and to be calm in the face of adversity.</p>
                <p>He never misses a workout, he always nourishes  his body with the best that nature provides, he never skips a doctor's appointment, and through that I've been able to learn to prioritize health and take care of my body.    </p>
                <p>He has also encouraged me to be disciplined, intentional and consistent with anything and everything I do. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.</p>
                <p><b>APPRECIATION; </b></p>
                <p>Thank you for all the sacrifices you have made, all the support you gave me when I needed it most and moulding me into the person I have become today.I adore you with all my heart and I'm proud to be yours.</p>
